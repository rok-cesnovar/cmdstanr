### New features

CmdStan to install. (#300, #308)

* Replaced `output_dir` with `dir` in `$sample()`, `$optimize()`,
`$variational()` and `$generate_quantities()`. `output_dir` is deprecated.

temporary. (#267, #272)


# cmdstanr 0.1.1

* New knitr engine `eng_cmdstan()` and function `register_knitr_engine()` that

instead of RStan. The new vignette _R Markdown CmdStan Engine_ provides a 
demonstration. (#261, #264, @bearloga)

# cmdstanr 0.1.0
